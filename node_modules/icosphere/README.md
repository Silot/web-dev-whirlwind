## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/icosphere.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/icosphere/)

### mesh = icosphere(subdivisions)

Creates a new icosphere mesh object. You'll want to keep `subdivisions` within
the range of 0 and 5 or it starts to get really costly. The mesh object has
the following properties:

* `cells`: an indexed list of each triangle's positions.
* `positions`: a list of positions for each vertex.
